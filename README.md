## Features 💡

● **Automatic Toll Deduction:**  Based on the user's journey distance, tolls are automatically deducted from their account.


● **User Data Privacy:** User data is protected to ensure privacy and security.

● **Multiple Payment Vendors:** Supports a variety of payment methods for user convenience.

● **Auto-Generated Invoices:** Invoices are automatically generated for each toll transaction, allowing for easy record keeping and analysis.

● **Auto-Fine:** A simulation automatically Generate fine for a vehicle if it cross speed limit.

● **Auto-Speed Generation:** Simulation 
automatically Generate Avg. speeds for vehicles (likely for analysis purposes).

● **Simulated Environment:** Built using Flask to create a realistic simulation of the automatic toll system.
